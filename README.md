## **Financial Calculators**

The financial calculator project is a Python application designed to assist users in calculating financial metrics. It offers two key features: an investment calculator and a bond repayment calculator. The application is designed to be user-friendly and requires only minimal inputs from the user.

## **NLP Applications**

The second capstone project involves the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in practical scenarios. The project comprises two tasks:

* In the first task, NLP applications were categorized based on different use-cases, like email categorization, essay grading, and providing diagnostic assistance for doctors. The complete analysis is documented in 'nlp_1.pdf'.

* The second task involves researching an innovative technology using NLP. A comprehensive summary of the technology, its functionalities, and an overview of its working mechanism are provided. The report is saved as 'nlp_2.pdf'.

## **Installation**

**To install and run the Financial Calculator:**

* Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.
* Ensure you have Python (version 3.6 or later) installed.
* Navigate to the directory containing the 'financial_calculator.py' script and run it using Python.
* To view the NLP Applications analysis, you simply need a PDF reader. Both 'nlp_1.pdf' and 'nlp_2.pdf' can be found in the root directory of the repository.

## **Usage**

**Financial Calculators**

Upon running the 'financial_calculator.py' script, you'll be prompted to choose between the 'investment' and 'bond' options. Follow the prompts to input the required details. The script will then output the results based on your inputs.

**NLP Applications**

The NLP applications project doesn't involve running a script. To read the reports, open 'nlp_1.pdf' and 'nlp_2.pdf' using your preferred PDF reader.
